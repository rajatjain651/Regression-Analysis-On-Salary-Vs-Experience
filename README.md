# Regression-Analysis-On-Salary-Vs-Experience
In this project we are negotiating the salary with a guy who has cleared all the interview rounds. 
he has been asked about his salary at the firm where he previously worked and he defined his role with job position suvh that it is level 6.5 on the given scale and salary 170000 USD.
We have got employees data to find out Salary for a given position level, to find out whether this guy is telling the truth or he is bluffing.
We have data of salary from position level 1 to 10 in USD.

On application of different regression algorithms we got this as output.

Decision tree - 150000 USD

Rabndom Forest - 167000

SVR - 170370

so model with SVR algorithm is the best in the given scenario.
